## 02 Implement A Model Class
* In the Solution Explorer pane, right-click the edX.DataApp.Lab.CoreConsole project, hover over the Add menu option and then select the New Item... menu option.
* In the Add New Item dialog, perform the following actions:
    * Expand the Visual C# Items node, and then select the Code node.
    * Select the Class template.
    *  In the Name box, enter the value Product.cs.
    *  Click the OK button.
* Once the file has been created, Visual Studio will automatically open the Product.cs class file. Leave this file open.
* In the currently open Product.cs file, ensure that an using statement exists for the System namespace:
```
using System;
```
* Add a new using statement for the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace:
```
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
```
* Update the Product class definition by setting a public accessor:
* Add a new int property named ProductId with public get and set accessors:
* Update the ProductId property by adding a Key attribute to the property:
* Add a new string property named Name with public get and set accessors:
* Add a new string property named ProductNumber with public get and set accessors:
* Add a new string property named Color with public get and set accessors:
* Add a new decimal property named StandardCost with public get and set accessors:
* Add a new decimal property named ListPrice with public get and set accessors:
* Your Product class should now look like this:
```
    public class Product
    {
        [Key]
        public int ProductId { get; set; }

        public string Name { get; set; }

        public string ProductNumber { get; set; }

        public string Color { get; set; }

        public decimal StandardCost { get; set; }

        public decimal ListPrice { get; set; }
    }
```
* Save and close the Product.cs class.
